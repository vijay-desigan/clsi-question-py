# 1528. Shuffle String --LEETCODE---
# You are given a string s and an integer array indices of the same length. The string s will be shuffled such that the character at the ith position moves to indices[i] in the shuffled string.

# Return the shuffled string.

 

# Example 1:


# Input: s = "codeleet", indices = [4,5,6,7,0,2,1,3]
# Output: "leetcode"
# Explanation: As shown, "codeleet" becomes "leetcode" after shuffling.

# Example 2:

# Input: s = "abc", indices = [0,1,2]
# Output: "abc"
# Explanation: After shuffling, each character remains in its position.

class Solution:
    def restoreString(self, s: str, indices: List[int]) -> str:
        string=""
        for i in range(len(indices)):
            index=indices.index(i)
            string+=s[index]
        return string
